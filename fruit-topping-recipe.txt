Ingredients

    1 ½ cups 1% milk
    1/4 cup granulated sugar (reduce to 3 tablespoons for less sweet dressing)
    1 ½ tablespoons corn starch
    2 teaspoons vanilla

    Instructions

    1)    In a medium skillet, whisk together milk, sugar and corn starch. Cook
    over medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 8-10 minutes
    (it won't be thick like pudding, it is a dressing — but it will thicken
    considerably).

    2)    Stir in vanilla. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature
    (you can speed this up by refrigerating for 30 minutes).

    3)    Serve at room temperature or chill to serve later. If making ahead,
    only add the dressing 1-2 hours before serving.
